# üåç React Countries App

A modern web application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** that allows users to explore countries from around the world. This app integrates with the [RestCountries API](https://restcountries.com) to fetch and display detailed information about each country, including flags, population, region, and capital city. The app also includes features such as dark mode, country search, and a persistent theme preference using **localStorage**.
